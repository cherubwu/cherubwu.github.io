Iâ€™m Cherub, a neuroscience enthusiast and multifaceted creative. My journey is all about blending the wonders of science with the beauty of art to explore, understand, and express the intricate nature of the world.

I am passionate about using art as a means to see the world and science as a way to color nature. Through this multimedia website, I aim to inspire others to dream, imagine, and connect with the world around them in new and profound ways.

My primary passions lie in painting, historical exploration, and creative daydreaming. These pursuits allow me to merge scientific inquiry with artistic vision, creating works that are both thought-provoking and visually captivating.

Iâ€™d love to collaborate with you to craft a vision and bring it to life, using the unique perspectives of art and science to illuminate the wonders of our existence!
