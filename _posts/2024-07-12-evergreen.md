*2015 Cherub* 

Descending leaves fall to the ground,  
Twirling, twisting, round and round,  
Autumn season is almost here,  
The smell of freshness is oh so near. 🌬️🍃

The crisp, cool breeze,  
Shakes the leaves from the trees,  
Autumn takes away the green,  
Golden-bronze and brown is all that can be seen. 🍂🍁

*Janary 2024 Cherub*
My eye blinks when solitude's a door, 🚪  
A rabbit hole behind the clock's decor. 🕰️🐇  
With rose-red cheeks and fire of love, 🌹  
A cloud of pride, like wings above. 🕊️

Which oft doth dark Her goodly light, 🌑  
With smiles, she dries away the night.🌟  
The rest are nature’s wonderment, ✨  
But this, the heart’s astonishment. 💖
