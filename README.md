About Me 🥕
Welcome to cherub’s little wonderland! I'm passionate about exploring the wonders of the brain and the creative depths of the human mind. With a background in Neuroscience, I am constantly fascinated by how our thoughts, dreams, and artistic expressions are intertwined. 

Neuroscience 👩🏻‍🎓
My academic journey in Neuroscience has equipped me with the knowledge and skills to understand the intricate workings of the brain. I delve into the complexities of neural networks, cognitive processes, and the mysteries of consciousness.

DayDream 👼🏻
Daydreaming is not just a pastime for me; it's a source of inspiration. It fuels my creativity and allows me to envision new ideas, concepts, and artistic expressions. It's in these moments of reverie that I find the spark for my artistic endeavors.

Paint 👩🏻‍🎨
As an artist, I love to paint and bring my imagination to life on canvas. My artwork reflects my inner world, blending scientific concepts with artistic flair. Each piece is a journey into the unknown, where colors and forms merge to tell a unique story.

History 🤴🏻
History fascinates me because it provides a rich tapestry of human experiences. I am drawn to the lessons and stories of the past, which often influence my work and perspective. Understanding where we come from helps me appreciate the beauty and complexity of the present.

Vision 🌈
I aspire to use "Art" to see the world in a new light and "Science" to color nature with deeper understanding. By merging these two passions, I hope to create a unique lens through which to explore and interpret the world around us.

Thank you for visiting Cherubwu dot com. I invite you to join me on this journey of discovery and creativity, where science and art come together to reveal the wonders of our existence.
